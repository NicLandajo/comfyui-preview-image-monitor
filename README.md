# Preview Image Monitor | Your prompts Fullscreen!

Preview Image Monitor is a ComfyUI custom node that enables real-time image preview on any monitor connected to your system.
It displays your generated images in fullscreen with professional grade viewing controls including adjustable fit modes
(fit, fill, 1:1, letterboxing, pillarboxing, etc.), exposure/gamma/saturation adjustments.
Select one of up to six secondary monitors.
The display renders as a background layer, ensuring all active windows remain visible and unobstructed.

Future improvements and Ideas for the node:

- WIPE A/B Comparison Tool: Directly compare two images or node outputs to quickly evaluate different prompts, seeds, or settings.

- Workflow Node Image cache/buffer: preview and compare outputs from any node in your workflow using hotkeys.

- Multi-Node Quadrant View: Monitor up to four different node outputs simultaneously by dividing the preview window into 4 dedicated quadrants.

- Adding  1366 × 768,  2560 × 1440  and  1536 × 864  resolutions.
