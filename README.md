# <h1 align="center">Preview Image Monitor 🖥️🖥️ Multimonitor Fullscreen!</h1>

Preview Image Monitor Pro is a ComfyUI custom node that enables real-time image preview on any monitor connected to your system.
It displays your generated images in fullscreen with professional grade viewing controls including adjustable fit modes
(fit, fill, 1:1, letterboxing, pillarboxing, etc.), exposure/gamma/saturation adjustments, color scopes and lookdev tools.
Select one of up to six secondary monitors.
The display renders as a background layer, ensuring all active windows remain visible and unobstructed.
